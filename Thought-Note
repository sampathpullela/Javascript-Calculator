1. I was creating a Simple UI based Javascript Calculator using technologies as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap.

2. In my overall application I have 3 files - 
    a. index.html
    b. style.css
    c. script.js

3.  It is having full of HTML elements and Tags, forms, buttons and script included.
    By using Bootstrap I have used the class row and col to make the input tags in a row with responsive. (so it will be occupiied each of 4, i.e 4/12, 4/12, 4/12).

4. I have created 2 input fields and 1 Select field, below the i have added a button with full length of viewport.
   For this button I have added an onclick event - performAction(), so when it is clicked the function will get triggerd which is in script.js file.

5. And at the end I have added result tag, it is a input field with 'Disable (read-only)' option so it will not allow us to write over in it.   Main purpose of this field is to show the results.

6. Used Bootstrap classes and button to make the code simple and responsive and not to apply CSS seperatly.

7. When coming to CSS code, I have added simple CSS to it, for body tag i have added display as flex so that i can arrange the items inside the body tag in a column direction.

8. When coming to Javascript code, I have added the function "performAction()", inside this I wrote the code for getting the values from input fields.
9. Next i have added the conditions to check the input field validations.
10. Later in the Switch case i have added the main code, here it will check the operations and push into the HTML page by 'document.getEemnetById('').value = $';.

11. For the input fields I have added event listners to make the result field blank every time I have clicked on input fields.
